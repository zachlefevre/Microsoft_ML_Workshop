    "### Types of ML\n",
    "There are several different type of machine learning. The easiest two understand as a beginner are:\n",
    "1. supervised\n",
    "    - data is labelled.\n",
    "2. unsupervised\n",
    "    - data is unlabelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "All types of machine learning require data. That data is a numerical vector. **EVERYTHING** in ML are vectors/matrices. Inputs, outputs, weights, scores, gradients, losses, etc\n",
    "* If the neural network is operating on images of handwitten digits which are of the size 28 x 28, then the input vector will be a single 784 length vector whose elements represent how dark each pixel is.\n",
    "* If the neural network is operating on 8 movie scores, then the input vector is an 8 length input vector where each element is the rating of one movie\n",
    "\n",
    "The more data you have, the better your NN will perform. Usually.\n",
    "* The more examples of images of numbers you have, the better your NN will do.\n",
    "* The more complex each training example is, the more likely you will overfit your NN to the training data.\n",
    "    * Intuitively, if the data is unecessarily complex then the NN will make assumptions based on those properties that it shouldn't. If my images of handwritten digits also contain color, and 60% of the images of '4' are blue, then our NN will assume that the more blue an image is, the more likely it is a '4'\n",
    "    * More complex data also means larger input vectors. If an image is 28 x 28 and there are 3 colors, then the input vector is of size 28 \\* 28 \\* 3. **The larger your input vector, the more likely you will overfit your data**. (**The more complex your data, the more likely you will overfit your data**.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #### What is overfitting\n",
    "    An overfit neural network is one which does very well classifying data it was trained on, but does poorly on new data.  \n",
    "        * If our NN can classify with 99% accuracy an element of our training data set, but only performs with an accuracy of 50% on an image it has never seen, then our NN is overfit.\n",
    "        ##### How to prevent overfitting\n",
    "        We split our data set into two groups.\n",
    "        1. Training\n",
    "            * We train on this set (obviously). If our NN mistakes a '4' for an '8', then we change our NN to better classify this '4'.\n",
    "        2. Testing\n",
    "            * We **never** train on this set. If our NN mistakes a '4' for an '8', then we store that it got it wrong, and use this tally to calculate how well our NN did.\n",
    "            * As we train our NN, we will test that our scores for the testing set are not going down. The testing scores going down signifies that we are overfitting.\n"

If the first layer is capable of finding how much each window is worth and how much the size of the yard influences the cost of the house, then the next successive layer will be capable of finding the subtle relationship between number of windows and size of yard and how that influences the cost of the house. The next layer can find how that relationship and some other subtle relationship affect the cost of the house. To construct an algorithm to quantify this without the help of a pattern recognizing neural network would be disgusting."
