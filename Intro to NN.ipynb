    "### Types of ML\n",
    "There are several different type of machine learning. The easiest two understand as a beginner are:\n",
    "1. supervised\n",
    "    - data is labelled.\n",
    "2. unsupervised\n",
    "    - data is unlabelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "All types of machine learning require data. That data is a numerical vector. **EVERYTHING** in ML are vectors/matrices. Inputs, outputs, weights, scores, gradients, losses, etc\n",
    "* If the neural network is operating on images of handwitten digits which are of the size 28 x 28, then the input vector will be a single 784 length vector whose elements represent how dark each pixel is.\n",
    "* If the neural network is operating on 8 movie scores, then the input vector is an 8 length input vector where each element is the rating of one movie\n",
    "\n",
    "The more data you have, the better your NN will perform. Usually.\n",
    "* The more examples of images of numbers you have, the better your NN will do.\n",
    "* The more complex each training example is, the more likely you will overfit your NN to the training data.\n",
    "    * Intuitively, if the data is unecessarily complex then the NN will make assumptions based on those properties that it shouldn't. If my images of handwritten digits also contain color, and 60% of the images of '4' are blue, then our NN will assume that the more blue an image is, the more likely it is a '4'\n",
    "    * More complex data also means larger input vectors. If an image is 28 x 28 and there are 3 colors, then the input vector is of size 28 \\* 28 \\* 3. **The larger your input vector, the more likely you will overfit your data**. (**The more complex your data, the more likely you will overfit your data**.)\n"

    "#### What is overfitting\n",
    "An overfit neural network is one which does very well classifying data it was trained on, but does poorly on new data.  \n",
    "* If our NN can classify with 99% accuracy an element of our training data set, but only performs with an accuracy of 50% on an image it has never seen, then our NN is overfit.\n",
    "    ##### How to prevent overfitting\n",
    "    We split our data set into two groups.\n",
    "    1. Training\n",
    "        * We train on this set (obviously). If our NN mistakes a '4' for an '8', then we change our NN to better classify this '4'.\n",
    "    2. Testing\n",
    "        * We **never** train on this set. If our NN mistakes a '4' for an '8', then we store that it got it wrong, and use this tally to calculate how well our NN did.\n",
    "        * As we train our NN, we will test that our scores for the testing set are not going down. The testing scores going down signifies that we are overfitting."
